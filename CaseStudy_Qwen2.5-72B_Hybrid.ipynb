To better describe the computing offloading process, this paper adopts integer variables $x_{u}^{t}\\in\\{0,1,2\\}$ to clarify the UE's task scheduling decision. If the UE's computing task is not offloaded in time slot $t$，$x_u^t$ is 0; if it is offloaded to the UAV, $x_{u}^t$ is 1; if it is offloaded to the BS, then $x_u^t$ is 2.\n",

When the UE offloads the task to the MEC servers, the total service time consists of three parts: the communication time required for offloading, the computing time required for performing the tasks on the MEC servers, and the communication time required for returning the computed results. Note that the amount of the computed results is relatively small (for example, the results of facial recognition occupy only a few bits), and the downlink information transmission rate is higher than the uplink information transmission rate. Therefore, similar to the work in [30], [34], and [33], the time to return the results from the edge to the UEs is usually negligible. If the task is selected to be scheduled for execution $x_{u}^{t}>0$, it can either offloaded to the UAV or the BS depends on the situation.
