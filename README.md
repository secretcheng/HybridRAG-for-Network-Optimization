# 🔍 HybridRAG-based LLM Agents for MEC Networks

> 🌟 This repository is the official source code from the paper of 	`LLM Agents for Low-Carbon Multi-UAV-assisted MEC Networks: A HybridRAG-based Approach`. Welcome to see our work in arxiv.

## 🎯 Overview
This project aims to jointly solve the communication optimization problem underlying MEC networks using HybridRAG and LLM Agents. We used **Qwen2.5-72B** in the example to build the optimization problem



## 🛠️ Technical Stack
- 🤖 LLM: Qwen2.5-72B-Insturct
- 🗄️ Tools: llamaindex
- 📝 Database: neo4j, qdrant


## 🤝 Plan
we will update the code in the future.
